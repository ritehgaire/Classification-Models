This project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the deep learning task of object identification, a critical aspect of computer vision. 

It provides an in-depth exploration of classification tasks using both labeled and unlabeled data, focusing on the identification of objects such as cats, dogs, and cars. 

The project employs advanced frameworks, including TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, and Fastai, to achieve its objectives. 

While the foundation has been established, there remains room for experimentation, and certain objectives are yet to be fully completed. 

Users are encouraged to experiment and extend the project further.
